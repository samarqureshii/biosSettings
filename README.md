# Bios Settings
> HW/SW Emulation of Windows Bios Settings in Nios II Architecture

## TODO
- VGA Driver (Annie)
    - Assume given input of fan speed and temperature, continually update as they increase/decrease on the VGA
    - UI similar to Task Manager
    - If time, real-time line graph that shows temperature and RPM changing overtime
- 
- Analog sensor read to MCU (Samar)
- I2C communication to DE1 via GPIO (Samar)
- PWM script 3.3V output (Samar) 
    - Can be tested without the temperature sensor 
- ~~Get 12V~~
- Test level shifter with 12V
- Look for cooling fan (Annie)
    - 4 wire ideally 
- ~~Batteries in multimeter~~
