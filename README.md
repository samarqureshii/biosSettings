# taskManager
> HW/SW Emulation of Windows Task Manager in Nios II Architecture

## TODO
- VGA Driver (Annie)
    - Assume given input of fan speed and temperature, continually update as they increase/decrease on the VGA
    - UI similar to Task Manager
    - If time, real-time line graph that shows temperature and RPM changing overtime
- Analog sensor read to MCU (Samar)
- I2C communication to DE1 via GPIO (Samar)
- PWM script 3.3V output (Samar) 
- Get 12V switching reg working 
- Test level shifter with 12V
- Power to cooling fan

## Parts to buy
- Temperature sensor (ask Nick)
- Figure out where we are getting 12V
- Cooling fan
